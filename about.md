Hello, my name is <strong>Priscilla Nguyen</strong>. I graduated from Malden High School in 2020 and currently live in Boston. I'm currently a senior major in <strong>Computer Science & Economics</strong> from <strong>Boston University</strong>, expecting to graduate in May 2024. I've also attained the Credential of Readiness by Harvard Business School Online for coursework in Financial Accounting, Business Analytics, and Economics for Managers. 

I began my journey in Computer Science during my second semester in college in 2021. I have a passion for developing software and apps that can be useful for young generations. I am proficient in various programming languages, including <strong>Java, Python, C, Bash, and Stata</strong>, across multiple platforms. I also have a keen interest in delving into scientific research, particularly in fields such as chemistry and biology. Feel free to explore the <strong>"Projects"</strong> and <strong>"Writing"</strong> tabs at the top of the page to see some of my creations and research.

In November 2022, I had a honor of achieving the <strong>first prize</strong> at BostonHacks, a hackathon organized by BU. I accomplished this feat alongside a team of 4, outshining more than 200 participants. Our product can help people monitor how our mood varies and better understand triggers that can cause the negative emotions they experience.

I'm a risk-loving, goal-oriented programmer passionate about problem-solving. I value collaboration, flexibility, and creativity, thriving in diverse and self-motivated environments.
